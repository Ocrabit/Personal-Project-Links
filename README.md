## List of Personal Projects
[Pokemon Prediction Data Analysis](https://github.com/Ocrabit/Pokemon-Prediction-Data 'Pokemon Prediction Data Analysis')
<br> <sub><i> A data analysis project using statistical modeling techniques like to first predict pokemon legendary status and then predict match outcomes. </sub></i>

[Knitting App Design Python](https://github.com/Ocrabit/TestKnit 'Knitting App Design Python')
<br> <sub><i> A designed to help knitters have a better way to create knitting patterns. This is a project that I used to sharpen my general skills in python and focus on good class management </sub></i>

[Belmont Transportation Hackathon](https://github.com/Ocrabit/Hackathon2024 'Belmont Transportation Hackathon')
<br> <sub><i> A hackathon I did in April of 2024 where we focus on trying to find solutions to a transportation issue in Nashville TN. My role was to create interactive maps using coordinate data of bus stops and different amenities like what bus stops had benches. I also used a converting library to get the zipcodes for each bus stop based on the coordinate location. This allowed us to look at each stop in regards to its demographic data. </sub></i>

[Connect Four Variation MiniMax Implementation](https://github.com/Ocrabit/Connect-Four-MiniMax-Implementation 'Connect Four Variation MiniMax Implementation')
<br> <sub><i> An implementation of the MiniMax algorithm for a Connect Four variation, showcasing three step ahead algorithmic thinking in a java environment. </sub></i>

[Dart Board Runnable Implementation with Swing](https://github.com/Ocrabit/Dart-Board-Runnable-Implementation-with-Swing 'Dart-Board-Runnable-Implementation-with-Swing')
<br> <sub><i> A Java project that features a Dart Board interface using the Runnable class and Swing for the UI. It includes reading and writing text files to save and load round histories. </sub></i>

[Office Game Boundaries of Swing](https://github.com/Ocrabit/Office-Game-Boundaries-of-Swing 'Office-Game-Boundaries-of-Swing')
<br> <sub><i> A Java Swing project where I implemented a lot of techniques learned in programming II. I focused on window management, thread handling, and running a game within a JLayered Pane, while making simple reusable components with support by good code management </sub></i>

## About Me
I am Marco Cassar!
I'm a college student passionate about data analytics and learning, with hands-on experience in statistical modeling and predictive analysis. While I'm still learning, I've applied my growing skills to projects like predicting Pok√©mon match outcomes and creating interactive maps to help better understand the transportation issue in Nashville. I generally just love anything in the realm of coding and am happy to learn whatever I can to best fit the needed skillset.
